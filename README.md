# ScreenRec
Screen recording for Mac

This was a freelancing job done for a client by the name of Shai Wolkomir : https://il.linkedin.com/in/wolkomir
The client used sleezy way with milestones on Upwork, so that he can get a product for fraction of the price we agreed upon, and later refused to pay.

So here's one of the first examples of the Screencapturekit used for recording to a file.

While functional the source code needs refinment and can serve as a good base for a whole product.

Enjoy.
